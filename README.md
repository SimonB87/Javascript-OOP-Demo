## What is Object-oriented programming (OOP)?

According to [Vangie Beal:](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/object_oriented_programming_OOP.html)

> Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.
> In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another. For example, objects can inherit characteristics from other objects.
